# python_rnd_collection


This is a collection of script, jupyter notebook or other.  That I gathered or wrote from time to time to help me understand or experiment ideas.
So not everything will work out of the box or would make sens out of context.

With time this will probably grow in every directions.

Let's try to keep it somewhat organised

## Todo list
(write here all the interesting stuff to do)

* read http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~aries/papers/johnson_phd.pdf (quaternion, limit, blend, rbf, ...)
* http://taichi.graphics/ library with a lot of simulation paper implemented.
